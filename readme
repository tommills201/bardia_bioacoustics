The following data were used and can be made avaialable on request:
1) Combined metadata for all years  = nepalbirds_metadata2
2) Combined metadata for 2021 = nepalbirds_metadata2021
3) BirdNET Detections for all year - *ADD HERE*
4) BirdNET Features for all year - *ADD HERE*
5) BirdNET Featurews sample of 7-days recordings every 2 hours = nepalbirds2021_sample3_even

01_NB25_map_plot.R
- GIS plotting of recorder locations
- Output is (Fig 1) Map of Bardia National Park

02_NB25_sample
- Sample creation
- Output is the sample for analysis: nepalbirds2021_sample3_even

03_NB25_cluster_and_evaluation2
- Dimensionality Reduction and HDBSCAN clustering 
- Removal of HDBSCAN noise cluster
- Evaluation of HDBSCAN parameter choices (Table 2)
- Creates validation sample 
- Tests for biases by Location (Fig 3 2D plot, plus ARI and AMI scores)
- Creates plot for recording sites (Fig 4 top right plot)
- Creates Histograms of highest percentage contributions of sites to clusters (Fig 4 and Fig 6)
- Also gives output is the sample for visual analysis labelled with clusters: nepalbirds2021_sample3_even_clustered

04_NB25_spectrogram_validation
- Creates spectrograms for random sample for visual analysis (Fig 3 spectrograms)

05_NB25_detections_by_cluster
- Assesses detections across clusters (Fig 5)

NB. Fig 2 was created in google slides and imported
